## Product images for the catalogue

Place product images here (recommended: **JPG** or **WEBP**, ~1200×800, landscape).

The catalogue currently uses filenames configured in `public/catalogue.js` (`imageSrc` fields).

Tip: If you add a `.webp` with the same base name, the site will prefer it automatically.

After adding/replacing images:
1. Commit + push to GitHub
2. The VPS will auto-deploy and the catalogue cards will update

If you want different filenames, update `public/catalogue.js` (`imageSrc` fields).
