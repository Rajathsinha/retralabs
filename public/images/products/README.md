## Product images for the catalogue

Place product images here.

This repo includes default **SVG** product images so the catalogue looks good out-of-the-box.
You can replace them with real photos (recommended: **WEBP**, ~1200×800, landscape).

The catalogue currently uses these filenames by default:
- `retatrutide.svg`
- `ghk-cu.svg`
- `hgh-191aa.svg`
- `igf-1-lr3.svg`
- `tirzepatide.svg`

If you want to use `.webp` photos instead, add them and update `public/catalogue.js` (`imageSrc` fields).

After adding/replacing images:
1. Commit + push to GitHub
2. The VPS will auto-deploy and the catalogue cards will update

If you want different filenames, update `public/catalogue.js` (`imageSrc` fields).
