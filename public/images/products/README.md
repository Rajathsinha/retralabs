## Product images for the catalogue

Place product images here (recommended: **WEBP**, ~1200×800 or similar, landscape).

The catalogue expects these filenames by default:
- `retatrutide.webp`
- `ghk-cu.webp`
- `hgh-191aa.webp`
- `igf-1-lr3.webp`
- `tirzepatide.webp`

After adding/replacing images:
1. Commit + push to GitHub
2. The VPS will auto-deploy and the catalogue cards will update

If you want different filenames, update `public/catalogue.js` (`imageSrc` fields).
